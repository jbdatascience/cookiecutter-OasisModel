### Change the value of LOCAL_SUPPLIER_HOME to the (relative) path of local
### supplier Git repository on the system you are building on, using the
### SUPPLIER variable and/or the HOME environment variable on your system
### if necessary.
###
### Also change, if necessary, the web service URL domain, if you are not
### building on a non-local system.

# You need to define the following variables:
#
#   * SUPPLIER - name of the supplier as given in the relevant model version file
#
#   * LOCAL_SUPPLIER_HOME - the (relative or absolute) path of the local Git
#                           repository for the supplier on the system; you can
#                           use the value of SUPPLIER or of the HOME environment
#                           variable on your system
#
#   * MODEL_NAME - name of the model as given in the model version file
#
#   * MODEL_VERSION - version of the model as given in the model version file
#
#   * DOCKERFILE - the name of the Dockerfile for the keys server
#
#   * BUILD_IMAGE_NAME - the intended name of the Docker image
#
#   * BUILD_CONTAINER_NAME - the intended name of the container
#
#   * LOCAL_KEYS_DATADIR - since the keys data directory is not version controlled
#                          this variable should store the path of model keys data
#                          directory; by default it is expected to be a subfolder
#                          of the keys_data directory in the supplier repo, named
#                          by the relevant model
#
#   * LOCAL_TEST_MODEL_LOCATION_FILE - the path of the model location file you
#                                      want to use for sending a keys request to the
#                                      web service running in the container; by
#                                      default an executable CSV file is expected,
#                                      other formats will cause a request failure;
#                                      the format should not be raw but consistent with
#                                      the format produced by Flamingo after the
#                                      transforms; by default this file is expected
#                                      to be found in the model subdirectory within
#                                      keys data directory
